# homeeToMqtt
Bidirectional Interface between homee and MQTT, which allows you to read and set states of device types managed in the Smart Home Gateway "homee" (https://hom.ee). 

## Info
This tool is still in alpha state.
The source is based on parts from following github projects:

* stfnhmplr/homebridge-homee
* stfnhmplr/node-red-contrib-homee

## Disclaimer
This tool uses a non official API from Codeatelier GmbH for the Smart Home Gateway "homee", which is subject to change at all times.

## Idea
This tool publish state changes of homee to MQTT and subcribes topics to change state of OnOff switches via MQTT.

MQTT messages are easily to subscribe in Node-Red, Homebridge, Hass.io or other gateways with MQTT clients.

## Installation
Just clone the repository (via git clone URL of this project) and change to the directory of the cloned repository.
Install all dependencies with:

    npm i

and run with:

    node app.js
    
You can optionally use the install scripts in the "rasperry" directory to either install homeeToMQTT and/or install the needed MQTT broker/server (Mosquito) on a RaspBerry PI. Adapt the UserNames and the hostnames in the file itself or change later on in the config.json described below.

Alternatively you could use [**homeean**](https://himpler.com/homeean) to install homeeToMqtt on a Raspberry Pi with a plain vanilla Raspbian installation. homeean is a web based buildtool, which generates an individual buildscript (Bash-Script) for user selected Smart Home Tools to be installed on a Raspberry Pi running on Raspbian. homeeToMQTT is provided as an homeean install option.

## config.json
homeeToMqtt looks for config.json in following order:
 - actual directory
 - /etc/homeeToMqtt
 - installed directory

Create a config.json in the desired folder as the app and adjust it to your needs

    {
        "homeeUserName": "mqtt",
        "homeePassword": "mqtt",
        "homeeServer": "homee.fritz.box",

    }

### Parameter description
- "homeeUserName": use your username (adding an own user for MQTT is a good idea)
- "homeePassword": use the password of the above user
- "homeeServer": use the hostname or IP of your homee here, ensure it has a static IP oif IP-adress is used
- "mqttServer": use the hostname or IP of your MQTT server/broker here (might also be localhost if on the same machine)
- "mqttUserName": use the defined user name for the MQTT server in use (might be left blank "" if no username is set)
- "mqttPassword": use the password for the defined user for the MQTT server in use (leave blank "" if no username/pw is set)
- "publish" publish homee states to mqtt as json
- "publishHuman": publish homee states to mqtt in a human readable fashion
- "publishInt" publish homee states to mqtt as single int value
- "publishBool": publish homee states to mqtt as boolen string value (True,False)
- "subscribe": subscribe to mqtt topics
- "subscribeHuman": subscribe to mqtt human fashion mqtt topics
- "identifier": path after homee for this mode
- "identifierHuman": path after homee for this mode
- "identifierInt": path after homee for this mode
- "identifierBool": path after homee for this mode
- "filterEchoedMQTTMessages": if true the next human message with the same MQTT topic as send from homeeToMqtt is ignored. Set it to true, if in human mode every message send from homeeToMqtt is directly receveived from MQTT and send via "put" to homee
- "homeeStatusRepeat": request full homee states every status timer seconds
- "statusTimer": time in seconds to send homee full stattus
